--> TDD (Test Driven Development)
    --> Coding a feature and test goes in hand in hand
    --> 1. Unit Test
    --> 2. Run the test

Features in enzyme:

Shallow Rendering : It takes the whole component as a unit for testing without affecting the features of its child components.
 
Note : If required, we can install enzyme apadter for full compactibility with react.

Features in Jest:

toMatchSnapshot() : It is a key method to use the feature of snapshot in Jest.
  -->Snapshot feature takes the history of the component and when it is updated, it compares and checks with the old snapshot features.
   
toEqual : This method takes the value as parameter and checks with the assigned value in code. The key is initiated in 'expect' method.
